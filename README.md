[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/TeamCityLABS.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/TeamCityLABS)

## Description

Basic [Dashing](http://dashing.io/) widget to display TeamCity build info. Based on [TeamCity Grouped Extended](https://gist.github.com/jimmirra/76272c91b70ec8ee372b). The widget has been trimmed back to display a bottom level Project and all associated builds. For each build, it displays the most recent build, the user who's check-in triggered the build and its' status. If a build has the state `FAILURE` then the widget flashes red.

##Dependencies

[teamcity-ruby-client](https://github.com/jperry/teamcity-ruby-client)
[httparty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty)

Add them to dashing's gemfile:

    gem 'teamcity-ruby-client'
    gem 'httparty'

and run `bundle install`.
